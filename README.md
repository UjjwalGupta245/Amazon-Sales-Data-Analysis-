# Amazon-Customer-Review-Analysis
This was an amazing project. I learned many new things in data analysis, like how to read data from an SQL database using Python, select different tables from an SQL database, do data cleaning, visualize data using different graphs, and answer questions using data analysis. I also used sentimental analysis for the first time using Python, and it was a different experience.
